# Weather Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project is part of the Lux Dev Data Career Bootcamp by Lux Tech Academy. The bootcamp aims to build an online coding school as good as MIT but as affordable as a gym membership, targeting African students. This project involves analyzing a weather dataset using Python and SQL to answer various questions and derive insights.

## Project Structure

1. **Part 1: Python Analysis**
   - Find all records where the weather was exactly clear.
   - Find the number of times the wind speed was exactly 4 km/hr.
   - Check if there are any NULL values present in the dataset.
   - Rename the column "Weather" to "Weather_Condition."
   - What is the mean visibility of the dataset?
   - Find the number of records where the wind speed is greater than 24 km/hr and visibility is equal to 25 km.
   - What is the mean value of each column for each weather condition?
   - Find all instances where the weather is clear and the relative humidity is greater than 50, or visibility is above 40.
   - Find the number of weather conditions that include snow.
2.  **Part 2: SQL Analysis**

We were to answer any of the four questions above after the Python analysis, and I chose to answer the following:
- Find all records where the weather was exactly clear.
- Find the number of records where the wind speed is greater than 24 km/hr and visibility is equal to 25 km.
- Find all instances where the weather is clear and the relative humidity is greater than 50, or visibility is above 40.
- Find the number of weather conditions that include snow.

## Tools Used
- Anaconda (Python)
- VS Code
- Microsoft Structured Query Language (MSSQL)
- Azure Data Studio

## Results

The results of the Python analysis are displayed in the Jupyter Notebook. The SQL queries' results can be obtained by running them on the loaded database.
